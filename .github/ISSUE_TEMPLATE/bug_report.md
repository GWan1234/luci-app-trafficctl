## What happened

## What you expected instead

## Router

- OpenWrt version (`cat /etc/openwrt_release | grep DESCRIPTION`):
- Device / architecture:
- Package version (`opkg list-installed | grep trafficctl` or `apk info luci-app-trafficctl`):
- Firewall backend — fw4/nftables or iptables (`command -v nft; command -v iptables`):

## Reproduction

## Diagnostics

Run the affected script by hand over SSH and paste its output — every script
prints JSON, and the message usually names the missing piece (a kernel module, a
device that could not be resolved). For example:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/trafficctl-shape.sh status 192.168.1.50
/usr/local/bin/trafficctl-summary.sh | head -c 2000
logread | grep trafficctl | tail -30
```

If the problem is in the web UI, the browser console output matters more than a
screenshot.
