# Contributing

Thanks for helping out. This is an OpenWrt LuCI package, which constrains what
the code may use rather more than a typical web project — most review comments
on first-time PRs are about the two constraints below, so please skim them
before you write anything.

## The two hard constraints

**Shell scripts are POSIX sh, running under BusyBox ash/dash — not bash.**
No arrays, no `[[ ]]`, no `<<<`, no `${var^^}`, no `local -a`. `awk` is BusyBox
awk, so gawk extensions (`match()` with an array, `gensub`, `asort`) are not
available. A bashism does not fail in CI's shell — it fails on the user's
router, at runtime, in a code path you did not test.

**Frontend JavaScript is ES5.** `var` and the `function` keyword only: no
`let`/`const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread,
`class`, `async`/`await`, `Object.assign`, `Array.prototype.includes`. LuCI
serves these files to the browser on whatever device the user administers the
router from, some of which are old. ESLint is configured with
`ecmaVersion: 5` plus `no-restricted-syntax`, so a slip fails CI rather than
reaching a user.

## Before you open a PR

```sh
# JavaScript: syntax and lint
node --check luci-app-trafficctl/htdocs/luci-static/resources/view/trafficctl/status.js
npm install && npm run lint

# Shell: syntax and static analysis
for f in luci-app-trafficctl/root/usr/local/bin/trafficctl-*.sh; do sh -n "$f" || echo "FAIL $f"; done
shellcheck luci-app-trafficctl/root/usr/local/bin/trafficctl-*.sh

# Tests — see docs/DEVELOPMENT.md for the full list and what each covers
bash tests/test_fw.sh
bash tests/test_direction.sh
bash tests/test_security.sh
```

CI runs the whole `tests/` suite, shellcheck, ESLint, and a compatibility matrix
that installs the built package inside real OpenWrt rootfs containers from
21.02 through 25.12.

## Writing tests

A test must exercise the real script. The suite historically contained tests
that redefined a local copy of the function they were checking, which meant
deleting the production validation entirely left them green — so a test that
does not fail when you break the code it names is worse than no test.

The pattern to copy is `tests/test_direction.sh`: put a fake `nft`/`tc`/`ip`/
`uci`/`curl` on `PATH`, redirect the script's `. /usr/local/bin/trafficctl-fw.sh`
line and its state-file paths into a temp dir with `sed`, run the real script,
then assert on the arguments the fakes recorded.

Verify your test by breaking the production code on purpose, watching the test
go red, and restoring the file.

## Anything touching the firewall, the shaper, or rpcd

These run as root with parameters that came from a browser, so:

- Validate at the boundary and re-validate in the script (`tctl_validate_ip`,
  `tctl_validate_target`, `valid_port`, `proto_tokens`). Never interpolate an
  unvalidated value into an `nft`/`tc`/`iptables` command line.
- Identify rules by the target, not by a caller-supplied label
  (`tctl_block_comment`, `tctl_ratelimit_comment`), and match the **full**
  comment on removal — an unanchored match on `192.168.1.1` also hits
  `192.168.1.10`.
- A control that cannot be applied must report that. Reporting success for a
  rule that was never installed is the worst outcome available, because the user
  believes a device is blocked when it is not.
- New rpcd methods need an entry in
  `root/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/luci-app-trafficctl.json`. Anything that changes
  state — or that returns the contents of a file — goes under `write`, never
  `read`: the read group is granted to unprivileged LuCI users.

## Commits and releases

Conventional Commits, because the release is automatic: `feat:` bumps the minor
version, `fix:`/`perf:`/`refactor:`/`ci:` the patch, a `!` (e.g. `feat(rpcd)!:`)
or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer the major. `docs:`/`chore:`/`style:` do not
release.

The footer is recognised only at the start of a line, followed by `:` or ` #`
(`BREAKING-CHANGE:` also works, per the spec). So you can discuss the footer in
a commit body — as this sentence does — without triggering a major release.

Merging to `main` tags, builds and publishes on its own, so a commit message
with a stray `;` or `)` is not merely untidy — the message is baked into a
generated shell script by the bundle pipeline.

Update `CHANGELOG.md` and the relevant file under `docs/` in the same PR as the
change.
